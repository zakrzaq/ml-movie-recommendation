# Movie Ratings Analysis

This project aims to analyze movie ratings data to gain insights and understand user preferences. The dataset used in this project contains information about user ratings for various movies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of movie ratings. It includes the following columns:

- `user_id`: Unique identifier of the user.
- `movie_id`: Unique identifier of the movie.
- `movie_title`: The title of the movie.
- `rating`: The rating given by the user for the movie.

The dataset is provided in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the movie ratings dataset (`ratings.csv`).
- `app.py`: code
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Analysis

The analysis is performed using the `app.py`. The script contains Python code that reads the movie ratings dataset, explores the data, and performs various analyses.

The main steps in the analysis include:

1. Loading the dataset.
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data.
3. Calculation of basic statistics such as average rating, highest-rated movies, etc.
4. Visualization of the ratings distribution, top-rated movies, etc.

## Usage

To run the analysis code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install pandas matplotlib`.
3. Clone this repository or download the project files.
4. Navigate to the project directory.
5. Run the `app.py` execute the code and view the analysis results.


## Conclusion

The movie ratings analysis project provides a starting point for exploring and analyzing movie ratings data. It offers insights into user preferences and can be extended to perform more complex analyses and build recommendation systems.

Happy analyzing!
